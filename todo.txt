when i save changes they are correct in onedrive but if i reload that same file its an old version  cached i assume

sometimes when i open a file the text is over the line numbers

scrolling is clumsy, text doesnt always move in the text window simetimes the cursor is outside the text windiw in the white space

file closer

save as

sometimes when i open a file the text is over the line numbers

optimize for mobile.  when vertical, left than half of screen is editor.  i primarily use vertical because the keyboard covers mist of the screen when rotated horizontal

add new file capabilty

add word wrap

add file closer

simple text buttons: new, open, save, save as, close

ask to save on close (i sometimes forget to save)

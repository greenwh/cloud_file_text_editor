# Project Overview
A lightweight Progressive Web App designed to provide seamless text file editing capabilities for Microsoft OneDrive files, specifically optimized for mobile devices. The application addresses the workflow gap of making quick edits to configuration files, code snippets, or notes without the cumbersome download-edit-upload process typically required on mobile devices.

2.  **File Browser**: Custom modal-based OneDrive navigation.
3.  **Text Editing**: CodeMirror editor with syntax highlighting and word wrap.
4.  **Full File Operations**: Open, Save, **Save As**, **New**, and **Close** files directly to OneDrive.
5.  **Unsaved Changes Guard**: Prompts user to save before closing a modified file.
6.  **PWA Capabilities**: Install to home screen, offline caching.
7.  **Mobile Optimization**: A robust, full-screen vertical layout with a compact, single-line control bar.
8.  **Language Support**: Auto-detection and highlighting for common file types.
### ?? Core Components
- **Authentication Manager**: Handles Microsoft login/logout and token management
- **Graph API Client**: Direct Microsoft Graph API integration for file operations
- **File Browser Modal**: Custom OneDrive folder/file navigation interface
- **Editor Interface**: CodeMirror integration with mobile optimizations
- **PWA Shell**: Service worker and manifest for app-like experience

## Current Status & Known Issues

### ?? Working Functionality
- User authentication via Microsoft OAuth 2.0.
- OneDrive file browsing and selection.
- File content loading, display, and editing.
- Syntax highlighting for multiple languages.
- **Full file lifecycle management (New, Open, Save, Save As, Close).**
- PWA installation and offline assets caching.
- **Robust mobile-first vertical layout.**

### ?? Known Issues
- **(Resolved)** UI Overlap: Text sometimes overlaps line numbers.
- **(Resolved)** Awkward mobile layout (editor only used half the screen).
- **(Resolved)** Inability to create new files or save untitled files.
- **(Minor)** Scrolling behavior in the editor on mobile can occasionally be clumsy.
- **(Minor)** The cursor can sometimes appear outside the text window in white space when scrolling.

### ?? Recently Implemented Enhancements
1.  **New File Creation**: Added the ability to create a new, blank text file.
2.  **File Closer**: Added the ability to close the current file.
3.  **Save As**: Implemented "Save As" functionality for file duplication and saving new files.
4.  **Word Wrap**: Added a toggle for word wrap in the editor.
5.  **UI Overhaul**: Redesigned the layout to be mobile-first, with a compact control bar and a full-screen editor that correctly resizes.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow
```javascript
// Client ID: 72445ccf-a776-4d59-a35e-eb790a5db442 (Public, safe to expose)
// Scopes: ["User.Read", "Files.ReadWrite"]
// Flow: OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE (redirect method)
```

### File Operations
- **List Files**: `GET /me/drive/root/children`
- **Read File**: `GET /me/drive/items/{file-id}/content`
- **Write File**: `PUT /me/drive/items/{file-id}/content`
- **Navigate Folders**: `GET /me/drive/items/{folder-id}/children`

### Security Model
- **Zero-Server Architecture**: No backend server, all operations client-side
- **Token Storage**: Session storage (not persistent)
- **Scoped Permissions**: Minimal required permissions only
- **Public Client**: Appropriate for client-side applications

## Development Evolution & Architecture Decisions

### Version History
- **v0.1**: Initial implementation using OneDrive.js File Picker SDK
- **v0.2**: Debugging phase - discovered COOP header conflicts with popup-based auth
- **v1.0**: Complete rewrite with custom Graph API integration, eliminating OneDrive.js

### Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Removed OneDrive.js**: Replaced with direct Graph API calls due to security policy conflicts
2. **Redirect vs Popup Auth**: Chose redirect flow for better mobile compatibility
3. **Custom File Browser**: Built modal-based file picker for better UX control
4. **Pure Client-Side**: Maintained zero-server architecture for security and simplicity

## Development Environment & Deployment

### Local Development
```bash
# Simple HTTP server for testing
npm install -g http-server
cd cloud_file_text_editor
http-server
```

### Deployment
- **Current**: GitHub Pages at greenwh.github.io/cloud_file_text_editor/
- **Requirements**: Static hosting with HTTPS support
- **Configuration**: Update `redirectUri` in script.js for different domains

### Azure App Registration
- **Client ID**: 72445ccf-a776-4d59-a35e-eb790a5db442
- **Type**: Single Page Application (SPA)
- **Redirect URI**: https://greenwh.github.io/cloud_file_text_editor/
- **Permissions**: User.Read, Files.ReadWrite

## Next Steps & Improvement Opportunities

### ?? High Priority Fixes
1. **UI Layout Fixes**: Resolve text/line number overlap and scrolling issues
2. **Mobile UX Polish**: Improve touch scrolling and cursor positioning

### ?? Enhancement Opportunities
1. **File Management**: Add close file, save as, rename, delete functionality
2. **Enhanced Editor**: Search/replace, themes, larger file support
3. **Offline Editing**: Enable editing with sync when connection restored
4. **Backup/Recovery**: Auto-save drafts locally for crash recovery
5. **Multi-File Support**: Tabs or file switching capability

### ?? Technical Improvements
1. **Error Handling**: More robust error messages and recovery
2. **Performance**: Optimize for larger files and slower connections
3. **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
4. **Testing**: Automated testing suite for core functionality

## Integration with AI OS

### Context File Purpose
This project represents a successful completion of a specific development goal - creating a mobile-optimized OneDrive text editor. It demonstrates:
- Full-stack thinking with zero-server architecture
- Integration with third-party APIs (Microsoft Graph)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- PWA development patterns
- OAuth 2.0 implementation
- Problem-solving through architecture evolution

### Lessons Learned
1. **Security Policies Matter**: Modern browser security can break older SDK approaches
2. **Direct API Integration**: Sometimes custom implementation is more reliable than SDKs
3. **Mobile-First Development**: Touch interactions require different UX considerations
4. **Authentication Flows**: Redirect flow is more robust than popup for mobile PWAs

### Future AI OS Integration
This project could serve as:
- **Template**: For other API integration projects
- **Component**: Mobile text editor for AI OS internal tools
- **Case Study**: Example of overcoming technical challenges through iteration

## Important File References
- **Main Logic**: `/script.js:1-50` (authentication and editor setup)
- **Authentication Config**: `/script.js:6-18` (MSAL configuration)
- **File Operations**: `/script.js:50+` (Graph API calls)
- **UI Structure**: `/index.html:16-50` (main application shell)
- **PWA Config**: `/manifest.json:1-21` (app metadata)
- **Known Issues**: `/todo.txt:1-12` (current problems and requests)

## Recent Development Activity (October 2025)

### Summary of Session (Oct 18, 2025)
- **Objective**: Address user feedback to improve mobile usability and add core features.
- **Implemented Features**:
    - Redesigned the UI for a mobile-first vertical layout with a compact top control bar.
    - Implemented "New File", "Close File", "Save As", and "Word Wrap" functionality.
    - Added a confirmation prompt to prevent losing unsaved changes.
- **Bug Fixes**:
    - Resolved a persistent CSS layout bug that prevented the editor from filling the screen height. The final solution involved a JavaScript-based layout manager (`updateEditorSize`) that programmatically resizes the editor on load and window resize events.
    - Fixed a CodeMirror rendering bug where text would overlap line numbers, especially in new files. The fix involved forcing a programmatic refresh of the editor after its content was changed.
    - Corrected a critical JavaScript `ReferenceError` by restoring accidentally deleted authentication functions.
- **Outcome**: The application is now significantly more feature-complete and usable on mobile devices. The most critical UI and functionality bugs have been resolved.
